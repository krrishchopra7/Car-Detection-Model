## üìå Objective
The objective of this project is to build an **accurate and efficient object detection system** for identifying cars in images using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning framework.

We began with **YOLOv5** to establish a strong performance baseline, then transitioned to **YOLOv8** for improved accuracy and robustness.  
Applications include **intelligent traffic monitoring** and **autonomous vehicle vision systems**.

## üìÇ Project Stages

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
- Collected and annotated images of cars.
- Bounding boxes in **YOLO format**.
- Dataset split into **train / val / test** folders.
- Prepared `data.yaml` for YOLOv8 training.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- **YOLOv5** trained as a baseline.
- Switched to **YOLOv8** for advanced architecture & better detection.
- Tuned parameters like:
  - Epochs: 50
  - Image size: 640√ó640
  - Batch size: 16

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction & Evaluation
- Generated predictions for the **test set**.
- Wrote a **custom evaluation script** to:
  - Compare predictions vs. ground truth.
  - Calculate **Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy**.
- Also evaluated with YOLOv8‚Äôs built-in `val` method to get **mAP** scores.

## üìù Conclusion
This project demonstrates how upgrading from **YOLOv5** to **YOLOv8** can yield noticeable improvements in object detection performance.  
YOLOv8 achieved:
- Higher **precision** and **recall**, meaning fewer missed detections and false alarms.
- A better **F1 score**, showing a stronger balance between accuracy and completeness.
- Increased **mAP** values, confirming improved localization and classification.

These results suggest YOLOv8 is more suitable for real-world applications such as **traffic monitoring** and **autonomous vehicles**, especially when accuracy and robustness are critical.
